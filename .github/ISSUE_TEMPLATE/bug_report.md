# The Problem
Explain the problem in as much detail as possible

Example:

The same result is produced each time instead of a random message each time

# Possible faults
If you know, list some possible places that the code could be failing at

Example:

- The random class is not implemented correctly
- The incorrect list is used
- The list only has one item in it
